In the domain of cloud computing, the orchestration of network traffic is vital for ensuring optimal performance. Cloud providers rely on virtual switches to decide which actions are to be perfomed on each network packet. These switches employ a series of predefined rules to determine the fate of each packet: whether it should be forwarded, modified, or dropped. The challenge lies in not just formulating these rules but also in finding their optimal arrangement within the virtual switch's pipeline in order to guarantee maximal network performance.

This project consists of the development of a software tool to solve the Automatic Placement of Rulesets problem. The tool aims to streamline the process of associating rules with packets, ensuring their efficient traversal through the network infrastructure. To achieve this, the tool harnesses the computational power of a Satisfiability Modulo Theories  (SMT) solver, which is capable of generating optimal solutions to complex optimization problems.

In the subsequent sections, this report specifies the problem statement, outlining the key objectives. Moreover, it discusses the implementation details of the software tool, highlighting the enconding of the problem into a SMT formula. Finally, it provides information regarding the installation and usage of the tool.
