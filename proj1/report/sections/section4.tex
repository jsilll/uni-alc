\subsection{Installation and Usage}

To utilize the developed solution for the Automatic Placement of Rulesets problem, you must first install Python 3.x
and the \texttt{pysat} library on your system.

\begin{verbatim}
      pip install python-sat
\end{verbatim}

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can proceed to runnning the script.

\begin{verbatim}
      python proj1.py < <input_file>
\end{verbatim}

The input file should follow the specified format, including the number of groups of rules, details about switches, stages, capacities, dependencies, and other necessary information. The script will process the input and display the output on the terminal. If a solution is found, it will present the minimum number of re-circulations, the positions of switches, and the groups allocated to stages within switches.
